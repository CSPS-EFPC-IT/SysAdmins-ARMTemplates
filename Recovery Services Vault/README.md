<h1>Recovery Services Vault</h1>
<p>There are multiples steps in order to enable Azure Backup for different resources.</p>
<p>The overal steps can be summarized as so:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create an Azure Recovery Services Vault for the solution you wish to backup.</li>
  <li>Create one or more Backup Policies in the created vault which will define your backup settings.</li>
  <li>Associate resources to backup with their appropriate Backup Policiy(ies) to enable backups.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Recovery Vault </h2>
<p>As mencionned above, the first step will be the creation the Azure Recovery Services Vault.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> If you wish to use an existing vault, you may proceed to the Backup Policies section below.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Use the VaultDeploy.json file (ARM template) in the current folder.</li>
  <li>Pass the following parameters:
    <ul>
      <li>projectName - The name of the project/solution of the items you wish to backup using this vault.</li>
      <li>environmentName - The environment The environment of the resources to backup. This string will be used to name
        all resources required.</li>
      <li>resourceTags - An array of tags to add to each resource created.</li>
    </ul>
  <li>The file will output the ID of the created vault.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Backup Policies</h2>
<p>Once a Azure Recovery Services Vault is created, you will need to add Backup Policies to define different backup
  settings.</p>
<p>It is important to note that their are default backup policies but it is recommended to create your own customized
  ones. <b>Note:</b> You may proceed to the next section if existing Backup Polocies within the vault are already
  configured to meet your requirements.</p>
<p>The creation of policies through ARM templates vary in configurations, which is why the policies will be created
  differently depending on the resource you wish to backup:</p>
<h3>Virtual Machine</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Go to the
      <a
        href=https://github.com/CSPS-EFPC-IT/SysAdmins-ARMTemplates/tree/Recovery-Services-Vault-1/Recovery%20Services%20Vault/VM%20Backup>VM
        Backup</a> folder where you will find the appropriate files to backup Azure Virtual Machines.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Azure File Share</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Go to the <a
        href="https://github.com/CSPS-EFPC-IT/SysAdmins-ARMTemplates/tree/Recovery-Services-Vault-1/Recovery%20Services%20Vault/Azure%20File%20Share%20Backup">File
        Share Backup</a> folder where you will find the appropriate files to backup Azure Storage File Shares.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>SQL Server on a Virtual Machine</h3>
<p>TBD</p>

<h2>Backups Enabling</h2>
<p>Finally, you will need to create Protected Items which are basically links between the resources to backup and their
  Backup Polocies.</p>
<p>The creation of these links through ARM templates vary in configurations, which is why the Protected Items will be
  created
  differently depending on the resource you wish to backup:</p>
<h3>Virtual Machine</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Go to the
      <a
        href=https://github.com/CSPS-EFPC-IT/SysAdmins-ARMTemplates/tree/Recovery-Services-Vault-1/Recovery%20Services%20Vault/VM%20Backup>VM
        Backup</a> folder where you will find the appropriate files to backup Azure Virtual Machines.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Azure File Share</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Go to the <a
        href="https://github.com/CSPS-EFPC-IT/SysAdmins-ARMTemplates/tree/Recovery-Services-Vault-1/Recovery%20Services%20Vault/Azure%20File%20Share%20Backup">File
        Share Backup</a> folder where you will find the appropriate files to backup Azure Storage File Shares.</p>

  </li>
</ol>
<h3>SQL Server on a Virtual Machine</h3>
<p>TBD</p>
